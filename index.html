            The Counsel has allowed MoogleBook™ to take control of the water supply.....The rainy season is approaching, and MoogleBook™ is having issues with their water collecting technology.....Until their technology is debugged, we need you to gather as much water as you can.....But watch out! Some of the water may be contaminated.....The good people of The Holy Commonwealth need you. Godspeed!
