### Backlog

The biggest issue that I had with creating this game was getting both of the players to be able to move simultaneously without any hiccups.  After learning more about the keyup and keydown events I was able to rewrite some code to fix this issue.  

As I continue to work on this game, I would like to add varying difficulty, and possibly even new levels!
